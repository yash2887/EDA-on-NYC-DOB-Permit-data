# EDA on NYC DOB Permit data

The goal of this project is to showcase my skill set on a real-world data set, to communicate and contextualize summary statistics, and, most importantly, my creativity and analytical rigor in generating and testing hypotheses. 

The data set at hand captures permits issued by the New York City Department Of Buildings (DOB), and can be found online. I have merged the NYC permit data with another data set to contextualize my investigation.
